# Read_Recorder
Read Recorder is an open source Android app used to collect audio data. This app will allow you to load in a, newline separated, text document and prompt the user to read each line one by one. After each recording session there will be a folder on the device containing the audio file and the corresponding prompted text for this recording session. This is a great tool to collect audio data.
